## Usage Examples

Find XSS parameters:
```
cat urls.txt | gf xss > xss_params.txt
```

Detect smart contract issues on Web3 platforms:
```
cat urls.txt | gf web3_smartcontract_vuln > smartcontract_findings.txt
```

Run full automation for all patterns (see `scripts/ultimate_hunt.sh`):
```
bash scripts/ultimate_hunt.sh domain.com
```

## **How to Use the Ultimate 58-Pattern Security Hunter Script**

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Linux system** (recommended: Ubuntu/Kali/Parrot or WSL on Windows)
2. **Tools installed:**
   - `gf` (pattern matcher)  
   - `anew` (deduplication utility; install with `go install github.com/tomnomnom/anew@latest`)
   - `subfinder`, `httpx`, `gau`, `waybackurls`, `katana` (install via Go or package manager)
   - All **58 JSON patterns** in your `~/.gf/` directory

### **Step 1: Save Script As File**

Save the provided script in your repository, e.g.
```
GF_Patterns/scripts/ultimate_hunt.sh
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x GF_Patterns/scripts/ultimate_hunt.sh
```

***

### **Step 2: Run the Script**

Syntax:
```bash
bash GF_Patterns/scripts/ultimate_hunt.sh target.com
```
- `target.com` : Replace this with the domain or target you want to scan.

***

### **Step 3: Understanding Script Workflow**

- **Recon Phase**: Discovers URLs (using subfinder, httpx, gau, waybackurls, katana).
- **Enumerate All 58 Patterns**: Loops over all patterns & matches using `gf`.
- **Deduplication**: Uses `anew` to ensure unique results per pattern.
- **Validation**: Checks hits with `httpx` for HTTP responses and outputs up to 20 valid URLs per pattern.
- **Intelligence Report Generation**: Summarizes findings per pattern and saves results.
- **Output Directory**: All results saved in a timestamped directory (e.g. `elite_hunt_20250817_170200`).

***

### **Step 4: Read Your Results**

- Each pattern will have its own findings file, e.g. `elite_advanced_pattern_results.txt`.
- Critical issues per pattern stored as, e.g. `critical_elite_advanced_pattern.txt`.
- Full intelligence summary in `elite_report.txt`.

***

### **Step 5: Typical Usage Commands**

```bash
# To list all detected endpoints by SSRF pattern
cat master_ssrf_bypass_results.txt

# To see critical validated URLs for SQLi
cat critical_sqli_results.txt

# To check your summary report
cat elite_report.txt
```

***

### **Best Practices**

- Always verify results with manual testing after automated scan.
- Update your tools & patterns regularly for better detection.
- Use in combination with other bug bounty and red team frameworks.

***

## **Troubleshooting**

- If any tool missing, install via Go:
  - `go install github.com/tomnomnom/gf@latest`
  - `go install github.com/tomnomnom/anew@latest`
- GF patterns must be available in `~/.gf/`
- For large scans, ensure system resources are sufficient.
